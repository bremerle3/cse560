Welcome to the Homework 6 Autograder! Let's test your code on a variety of settings.

Test #1. Rename Only with 64 physical registers
HW 6 Printout for i-forgot-to-replace-this-string-with-my-wustlkey
-----------------------------------------------------
Trace name  				sjeng-10M
Instruction Limit			500000
Processor Configuration:
  Machine Width 			0
  Number of Logical Registers 		50
  Number of Physical Registers 		64
  ROB Size 				0
  NOT modeling memory dependences
Reached insn limit of 500000 @ cycle 499999. Ending Simulation...
Processed 500000 trace lines.
Instructions:
  N Fetched =    		500000
  N Committed =  		500000
Stalls:
  Fetch stalled (ROB full) =    0
IPC: 				1.000
